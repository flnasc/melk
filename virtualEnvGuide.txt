from project folder: 

    Install package: pipenv install {packageName}

    Run command in virtual environment: pipenv run {command}
        Ex: pipenv run python3 testFile.py 
    
    Activate virtual environment in this shell: pipenv shell

    Deactivate virtual; environment in this shell: deactivate
    
    Create list of installed packages: pip freeze > requirements.txt

    Install packages listed in requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt

    For now, check if the virtual environment is running by doing:
        python3 testFile.py
        If that does not work, not running (Requests package is not installed on system)

To add pipenv to my path, I added the following line to /Users/{my_username}/.zprofile  
PATH="$PATH:/Users/{my_username}/Library/Python/3.10/bin"
